Useful scripts I used for job automation

- video_file_finder.py - searches for videofiles inside given directory

- umbrella_reminder.py - performs a web scrapping on the common weather forecast website every day at 19:00. 
If it is going to rain next day it uses twilio to send a text message to inform about the weather.
- mapit.py - launches a map in the browser using an address from the command line or clipboard
- pdf_paranoia.py - finds all pdf files in current working directory and encrypt them with provided password
- pdf_encrypter.py - encrypt given file with provided password
- pdf_decrypter.py - finds every encrypted pdf file in current working directory and creates a decrypted copy using a provided password.
